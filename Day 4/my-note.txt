We will learn about function, package, and module in this chapter.

If we write function format then doing the particular work becomes easy and 
the function can be reused.
So, basically reusability, readability, and easy debugging
are some of the main advantages of using functions.

Devops function example:

Terraform?:
We use 

Ansible? function
Puppet? function
Chef? function

Modules or modular approaches:
Reusable (imp)

--------------
input
perform the required logic
return output

---------------
Packages:
A collection of related software packages.

Modules is collection of functions.
Now, packages are collection of modules.

Packages acan also be called libraries

------------------
Api request? some people have already wirtten the code.\
So, talikng to apis all the modules are available and we will directly use them
Not like writing all the modules from scratch

PYPI --- it's really good to find the packages that you want.
or libraries that you want
(Find, install and publish Python packages with the Python Package Index)

The Python Package Index (PyPI) is a repository of software for the Python programming language.

---------------------
pip --> can install anything that is available in pypi

----------------------
#Example how to install boto3
pip install boto3 

--------------------
How to see what all packages are installed in my system?
Run the below command:
pip list

--------------------
#some machine might not have pip itself, we can search the command based on system and install it

--------------------
Virtual enviornment:
why use?
when you want to run your code in different environment.

--------------------
Install virtual env tool:
pip install virtualenv

create virtual environment:
(can replace by any name project-name)
python -m venv project-name

activate the virtual environment:
source project-name/bin/activate

To come out of that environment:
deactivate

(Multiple developement team and multiple version)
