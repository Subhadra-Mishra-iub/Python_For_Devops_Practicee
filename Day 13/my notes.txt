Boto3 module details:
--- First we need to know how to create s3 buckets fron UI
--- AWS CLI? 
--- Lambda Functions?
---------------------------
Can check the boto3 documentation for more details
For specifically s3: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3.html

What is boto3?
Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python. 
It allows Python developers to interact programmatically with AWS services, making 
it easier to create, configure, and manage resources such as Amazon S3, EC2, DynamoDB, 
and Lambda directly from Python scripts.

-----------------------------
Example:
import boto3

# Create an S3 resource
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

# List all bucket names
for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
    print(bucket.name)

-----------------------------
Note:
boto3.client is a lower-level interface designed for developers 
who need detailed control over AWS service interactions, while
boto3.resource abstracts away much of the complexity for easier 
and more Pythonic usage.

So, go with client.
