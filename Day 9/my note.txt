if we know the number of execution then for is most preferable 
and if we dont know the number of execution then the loop while will be used.

Examples:
print a name till all the files in a particular folder is deleted.
So, here while is preferable

sudo code: 
while(files in folder are empty)
    print("deleting files")

--------------------------------------
break
continue
