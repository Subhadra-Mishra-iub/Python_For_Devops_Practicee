Dictionary and Sets

## What is a Dictionary in Python? and why?

A dictionary is an unordered collection of data values, used to map names to related values. 
A single dictionary object can store multiple key-value pairs (or just 'entries' from now on)

We can store these properties in a list as well but it will be difficult to know what is the property of what 
like is the element is id or name or type?

Example: 
{
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "class": "11"
}
